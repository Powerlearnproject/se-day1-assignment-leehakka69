Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the process of developing all sorts of programs and applications that are designed to solve particular tasks. This is mostly done by coding. Importance:
•	To create responsive websites to enable companies to display their products and services.
•	Allows for creation of web applications and social media like Facebook and Instagram.
•	Used in game development for PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox.
•	Used to design Satnav systems like TomTom and Garmin.
•	Helps in designing medical equipment.
•	Used to make cars’ radios and operating systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1)	EARLY DAYS (1940s – 1960s)
The computers were massive, complex to program and expensive. Early programmers had to write the machine code. The programs were difficult to write and debug. The milestones are:
•	1948: The compiler is developed by Grace Hopper.
•	1957: The first high level programming language, FORTRAN, is released.
•	1960s: Coining of the term “software engineering”.

2)	SOFTWARE CRISIS (1960s – 1980s)
Softwares began getting more complex which led to problems like the softwares being late, not meeting the requirements and littered with bugs. The software developers were also few. The milestones are:
•	1968: The first NATO software engineering conference.
•	1970s: Development of structured and object oriented programming.
•	1980s: CASE (Computer aided software engineering) tools were released.

3)	AGILE DEVELOPMENT (1990s – Today)
Traditional software development methodologies were often seen as slow and inflexible, so agile development emerged. The milestones are:
•	1990s: The evolution of the internet and with it came SEO (Search engine optimization) and HTML (Hypertext markup language). Growth of viruses and spam emails became an issue and solutions were developed.
•	21st century: Lightweight and faster methodologies like extreme programming (XP) were developed. Softwares today are simpler and more flexible than ever before.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
•	Planning: Identify or create a problem, do as much research as possible about the problem and craft your solution. Ask yourself what the destination is and how much value your software adds to the user.
•	Requirements specification: This is also coupled with requirement analysis. Do as much research as possible about the specifications of your machine. What processor clock speed, size of RAM and ROM and operating system is needed from the machine? What languages will be used? What are the costs that are to be incurred along the way and at the destination? All this and more.
•	Design: Focusing on the overall design of the software (Back end programming). Draw all manner of flowcharts if necessary. Do a write up of the program’s code, this will prevent you from thinking too much on the job.
•	Coding: Write the actual code (Front end programming). Keep the code simple and stupid, this will save you a lot of time and mental energy. Use a good font for paragraphs and pixel size for images.
•	Testing and debugging: Once the coding is done, check for any errors, runtime or logical (Most coding apps that use Python and Java have debuggers). Then save and test for a result. If it is web based, see how it looks on a browser.
•	Implementation and maintenance: Upload the software onto a hosting site and update it regularly to keep up with the times.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
AGILE	
Iterative approach, focuses on flexibility, adapting to changes and collaboration among teams.	
Struggles with predictability.	
Initially expensive but the expenses reduce over time.	
Ideal for projects with evolving requirements.	
Flexible.	

WATERFALL
Sequential approach, each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
Is predictable.
Initially has fixed costs but the expenses may increase over time.
Ideal for projects with defined requirements.
Rigid.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1)	SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
•	Coding the softwares from scratch.
•	Making sure the software is up to date.
•	Sourcing for hosting and domains.
•	Making sure there are no bugs in the system.
•	Carrying out basic maintenance. 

2)	QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER 
•	Designing and implementing test frameworks.
•	Developing automated tests.
•	Ensure overall quality of the software.
•	Verifies if the product meets the requirements of the user.
•	Gives reports to a manager.

3)	PROJECT MANAGER
•	Manages the resources for the project.
•	Mitigates the risks that could occur.
•	Oversees the planning and execution of the software projects.
•	Aligns the project with the company goals.
•	Lead daily scrum meetings.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
•	They provide a place to write the code.
•	They make developers more efficient.
•	They help developers identify and avoid mistakes.
•	Combine all capabilities (editing, building, testing and packaging) in one application.
•	Faster build automation (Preparing a code for execution).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Softwares are susceptible to hackers.	Overcome by using strong passwords and encryption.
Expensive hardware is needed to run some software because of processing power.		Overcome by trying to figure out places where costs can be cut.
Softwares are prone to malware attacks.		Overcome by using an antivirus and not clicking on ads. 
Stiff competition among software engineers.		Overcome by looking for ways to stand out in the market.
It’s time consuming to code.	Overcome by	leveraging the use of AI.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1)	Unit: Testing the smallest piece of software to verify its behavior. It makes sure the code satisfies the requirements.
2)	Integration: Evaluates how different components of a system interact when combined. This ensures that the components work together seamlessly.
3)	System/system integration: A quality assurance team evaluates how components of an application interact in the integrated system or application. It verifies that the application performs tasks as designed.
4)	Acceptance: Determines to what degree an application meets the business’s and user’s approval. Can be beta, application, field or end user testing. It’s the final testing stage before releasing the system for production.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting instructions in a way that gets you the best responses from your robot. It’s important to AI because most AI chatbots can only act based on what a human being has fed them.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1)	Vague prompt: Write a French composition.
2)	Improved prompt: Write a composition for a 9 year old third grader about a frosty Friday morning in French.
3)	The improved prompt is more effective because it doesn’t leave open ended questions for the AI to guess things. Instead, the AI can deliver exactly what you want. The 
    vague prompt would have made the AI give you just any composition, only checking the language box.
